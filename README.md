### Key Components

#### Media Validator (Python Backend)
- **Location**: `/midia-validator`
- **Purpose**: Handles media file analysis and validation
- **Main Features**:
  - Metadata extraction
  - File format validation
  - Image/video analysis
  - Temporary file management

#### API Routes (Next.js)
- **Location**: `/app/api`
- **Purpose**: Server-side API endpoints
- **Key Endpoints**:
  - `/api/did`: DID creation and management
  - `/api/ipfs`: IPFS storage operations
  - `/api/resource`: Resource creation and verification

## The Challenge 🎯

In today's digital landscape, AI-generated content is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from human-created media. This poses significant challenges for:
- Content creators proving their work is authentic
- Journalists verifying source material
- Legal professionals validating evidence
- Digital artists protecting their creations

## Our Solution 💡

CheqDeep leverages Cheqd's blockchain technology to create an immutable chain of custody for digital media. By combining DID Linked Resources with rich metadata capture, we provide a robust verification system that proves media authenticity.

### Key Technologies ⚡

- **Cheqd Blockchain**: For immutable storage and verification
- **DID Linked Resources**: To store and link media metadata
- **IPFS Integration**: For decentralized media storage
- **W3C Standards**: Following DID and Verifiable Credentials specifications

## Current Limitations ⚠️

- Only accepts real-world photos and videos (no artistic content)
- Requires direct upload from capture device
- Limited to image and video formats
- No support for professional camera exports
- No batch processing capabilities

## How It Works 🔄

1. **Media Capture & Analysis**
   - User uploads media (image/video)
   - System captures device metadata

2. **DID & Resource Creation**
   - Generates unique DID for the creator
   - Creates DID Linked Resource with metadata
   - Stores media hash and verification data

3. **Blockchain Certification**
   - Links media to creator's DID
   - Creates immutable timestamp
   - Establishes verifiable chain of custody

4. **Verification Process**
   - Anyone can verify media authenticity
   - Checks DID Linked Resource data
   - Validates blockchain signatures

## Technical Implementation 🛠️

### DID Linked Resources
- Stores media metadata in Cheqd's blockchain
- Links content to creator's DID
- Maintains immutable verification history

### IPFS Integration
- Decentralized storage for media files
- Content-addressed storage
- Permanent accessibility

### Verification System
- Real-time DID resolution
- Resource metadata validation
- Blockchain signature verification

## Architecture 🏗️

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14**: React framework with App Router
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with dark mode support
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Client Components**: Interactive UI elements
- **Server Components**: Static and dynamic rendering

### Backend Services
- **Media Validator API**: FastAPI service for metadata extraction
  - Image and video analysis
  - EXIF data extraction
  - Technical marker verification
- **Cheqd Studio API**: DID and Resource management
- **Pinata API**: IPFS storage integration

### Data Flow
1. **Media Upload**
   - Client-side compression
   - IPFS for permanent storage

2. **Authentication**
   - DID-based identity
   - Resource verification
   - Blockchain signatures

3. **Verification**
   - DID resolution
   - Resource metadata validation
   - Content hash verification

### Infrastructure
- **Vercel**: Frontend deployment
- **Railway**: Media Validator API hosting
- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage
- **Cheqd Blockchain**: DID and Resource storage
